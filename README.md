### Hi there!

As a young man studying in the programming industry, I am eager to learn and improve my skills and always stay up to date with the latest technology trends. With a experience in HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP and React, I'm currently focused on front-end programming and excited to start interning with a team and contributing to the success of their products.

Confident in my abilities, I look forward to evolving and growing as an analyst in the systems industry. I am self-taught and continue to learn independently through online courses and tutorials as I pursue my university studies.

As a newcomer to my professional journey, I understand the importance of building a solid foundation and am excited to apply my knowledge and skills to contribute to a company's growth and success. With a passion for programming and a commitment to self-improvement, I am confident in my ability to take on new challenges and achieve my goals within the industry.
